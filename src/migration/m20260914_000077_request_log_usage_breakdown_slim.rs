/// `raw_usage_extra`. Anthropic attribution maps made that member grow with conversation
/// length: on production it averaged 24 KB per row and occupied 3.29 GB of a 3.8 GB
/// database while no dashboard surface read it. New rows no longer write the member
/// (RL15c); this migration rewrites rows that still carry it.

/// `instr` guards the JSON parse so untouched rows stay byte-identical, which also makes
/// the migration idempotent. File compaction is a deployment-time VACUUM, not this
/// migration, because SQLite returns freed pages to the file free list.
