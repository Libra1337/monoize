# Model Metadata Dashboard Specification

## 0A. LynShen migration release

MD-MIG-1. Model metadata and billing-rate records remain administrative source catalogs.
After the Provider pricing migration, `pricing_profile_model_patterns` and metadata Profile
suggestions MUST NOT select a runtime Provider billing Profile. Runtime selection MUST use
`provider-pricing.spec.md` PP-E1 through PP-E4.

MD-MIG-2. Every committed Marketplace-relevant insert, update, delete, and bulk sync in
this subsystem MUST advance `marketplace_generation` through the database triggers in
`model-marketplace.spec.md` MM-G1 through MM-G13. A rolled-back write MUST leave the
generation unchanged.

MD-MIG-3. The authenticated Model Database and Billing Profile tabs remain Console
surfaces. The public Marketplace is a separate read-only surface governed by
`model-marketplace.spec.md` and MUST NOT expose Profile names or source catalog rows.

## 0. Status

- Product name: Monoize.
- Scope:
  - dashboard UI page `/dashboard/models` for viewing/editing model metadata;
  - dashboard UI tabs for billing-rate records and pricing-profile patterns;
  - CRUD REST endpoints for `model_metadata_records`;
  - CRUD REST endpoints for `billing_rate_records`;
  - sync-vs-manual priority semantics.

## 1. Data Model

MD1. This spec operates on `model_metadata_records` (defined in `user-billing-and-model-metadata.spec.md` § 7) and `billing_rate_records` (defined in `metered-billing.spec.md` § 1).

MD2. `model_id` (PK) is the **bare model API name** (e.g. `gpt-4o`, `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`), not prefixed with provider.

MD3. `source` column distinguishes record origin:

| `source` value | Semantics |
|----------------|-----------|
| `models_dev` | Populated or last updated by Models.dev sync |
| `manual` | Created or last updated by admin manual edit |

MD4. All pricing fields are nano-dollar integer strings (same precision as billing spec).

MD5. `raw_json` stores all provider variants from models.dev as `{ "providers": { "openai": {...}, "azure": {...}, ... } }`. Every value inside a variant's `cost` object MUST be stored and returned as its exact decimal string rather than a JSON number. This enables the edit UI to switch pricing source without JavaScript binary-floating-point conversion.

MD6. `models_dev_provider` indicates which models.dev provider's pricing is currently applied.

MD7. Billing computation MUST NOT read model pricing directly from `model_metadata_records`. Billing computation MUST read `billing_rate_records`.

MD8. When a model metadata row is created, updated, or synced with token prices, the server MUST mirror the present token prices into `billing_rate_records` rows whose `source` identifies the metadata origin.

MD9. Every non-null metadata price and every billing-rate `unit_price_nano_usd` MUST be a canonical non-negative integer string. A negative, signed-plus, fractional, exponent, or out-of-range value MUST be rejected with `400 invalid_request`.

MD10. Models.dev decimal USD-per-million prices MUST be parsed directly from their JSON decimal token. The conversion to nano-USD per token is `trunc(price_usd_per_million * 1000)`. This conversion MUST NOT pass through `f32` or `f64`. For example, `1.001` MUST become `"1001"`.

## 2. Sync Priority & Merge

SP1. `POST /api/dashboard/model-metadata/sync/models-dev` MUST skip upsert for any row whose current `source = 'manual'`.

SP2. Rows with `source = 'models_dev'` (or no prior row) MUST be upserted normally.

SP3. When models.dev contains the same bare model name under multiple providers:
  - Group all variants by bare model name.
  - Select the default variant using the following priority:
    1. **Official provider preference**: If the canonical `model_id` belongs to a known model family, prefer the variant from that family's official provider — but only when that variant has strictly positive `input_cost_per_token_nano`. The known family→provider mappings are:
       - Model IDs starting with `gpt-` or `o` followed by a digit (e.g. `o1`, `o3-pro`) → provider `openai`
       - Model IDs starting with `claude-` → provider `anthropic`
       - Model IDs starting with `gemini-` → provider `google`
       - Model IDs starting with `grok-` → provider `xai`
       - Model IDs starting with `deepseek-` → provider `deepseek`
       - Model IDs starting with `mistral-` or `codestral-` or `pixtral-` or `ministral-` → provider `mistral`
    2. **Highest-cost fallback**: If no official provider variant exists or it lacks positive pricing, fall back to the variant with the highest non-zero `input_cost_per_token_nano`. This prevents resale losses when the platform charges users based on the stored price.
  - Store all variants in `raw_json.providers` so the user can switch sources in the edit UI.

SP4. Sync MUST first delete all records with `source != 'manual'`, then insert new data. This ensures models removed upstream are also cleaned up. Sync response MUST return `upserted`, `skipped`, and `deleted` counts.

SP5. During sync, canonical `model_id = "auto"` MUST be ignored (not inserted/updated).

SP6. During sync, a grouped model MUST be ignored when **all** variants have missing or non-positive (`<= 0`) `input_cost_per_token_nano`. In other words, at least one variant must have strictly positive input pricing to be eligible.

SP7. During sync, canonical model IDs that end with `-thinking`, `:thinking`, or `-think` MUST be ignored (not inserted/updated).

SP8. Admin MAY explicitly reset a manual record back to sync-managed by updating it with `source = 'models_dev'` via the PUT endpoint, after which subsequent syncs will overwrite it.

## 3. CRUD Endpoints

### 3.1 List model metadata

- Method/Path: `GET /api/dashboard/model-metadata`
- No changes from original spec.

### 3.2 Get single model metadata

- Method/Path: `GET /api/dashboard/model-metadata/{model_id}`
- No changes from original spec.

### 3.3 Upsert model metadata

- Method/Path: `PUT /api/dashboard/model-metadata/{model_id}`
- Auth: admin required.
- Body (all fields optional):

```json
{
  "models_dev_provider": "openai",
  "mode": "chat",
  "input_cost_per_token_nano": "30000",

- If row does not exist: insert with provided fields, `source = 'manual'`, `raw_json = '{}'`, `updated_at = now()`.
- The metadata write and deletion/replacement of its generated `billing_rate_records` mirror rows MUST execute in one database transaction. Any mirror failure MUST roll back the metadata write.
- Response: `200 OK` with the full updated `ModelMetadataRecord`.
- Errors: `400 invalid_request` if `model_id` path param is empty.

### 3.4 Delete model metadata

- Method/Path: `DELETE /api/dashboard/model-metadata/{model_id}`
- Auth: admin required.
- Response: `200 OK` with `{ "success": true }`.

## 4. Dashboard UI

### 4.1 Page location

UI1. Page MUST be accessible at `/dashboard/models`.

UI2. Sidebar navigation MUST include a "Models" entry between "Playground" and "Users" in the admin section.

### 4.2 Layout

UI3. Page MUST follow standard dashboard layout: `PageWrapper`, `text-3xl` heading, motion animations.

UI4. Page heading: "Model Database" (en) / "模型数据库" (zh).

UI4a. The page MUST contain three tabs in this order:

1. `Model Database`
2. `Billing Profiles`
3. `Advanced Rates`

UI4b. Each tab MUST use SWR for data loading, skeleton fallback while loading, and optimistic updates for user-triggered mutations.

### 4.3 Model Database tab: compact virtualized list

UI5. Default display MUST be a compact virtualized table (`TableVirtuoso`) with columns:

| Column | Content |
|--------|---------|
| Model | Provider icon (from `models_dev_provider`) + `model_id` (bare name) |
| Input | `input_cost_per_token_nano` formatted as `$X.XX / 1M tokens` |
| Output | `output_cost_per_token_nano` formatted as `$X.XX / 1M tokens` |
| Context | `max_tokens` formatted with `K` suffix |
| Source | Badge showing `models_dev` or `manual` |
| Updated | Relative timestamp |

UI5.1. In the Model column badge, GLM-series icon compatibility MUST follow `dashboard-ui-layout.spec.md` PL14.1.

UI6. Each row MUST be clickable to open an edit dialog.

UI7. Price display: `nano_per_token / 1000` = dollars per 1M tokens. Display up to 4 decimal places.

UI7a. Model Database and Billing Profiles MUST keep nano-USD prices and USD-per-million form values as decimal strings. Conversion, provider switching, form editing, validation, and API serialization MUST NOT pass a price through JavaScript `Number`, `parseFloat`, `toFixed`, or binary floating-point arithmetic.

UI7b. Converting a USD-per-million input to nano-USD per token MUST compute `trunc(input * 1000)` with decimal-string arithmetic. A negative or syntactically invalid input MUST be blocked before the mutation request. For example, `1.001` MUST serialize as `"1001"` and round-trip back to `1.001`.

### 4.4 Search and filter

UI8. Page MUST include a search input that filters by `model_id` substring (client-side).

### 4.5 Edit dialog — provider source switcher

UI9. When `raw_json.providers` contains multiple entries, the edit dialog MUST show a provider selector listing available providers with their pricing.

UI10. Selecting a provider MUST auto-fill all pricing and limit fields from that provider's data in `raw_json.providers[provider]`.

UI11. The user MAY further edit the auto-filled values. Any save always sets `source = 'manual'`.

### 4.6 Actions

UI12. Page header:
- "Sync Models.dev" button: triggers sync, shows loading, toast with upserted/skipped counts.
- "Add Model" button: opens create dialog.

UI13. Edit dialog MUST include a "Delete" action.

UI14. After any mutation, the model list MUST revalidate via SWR.

### 4.7 Loading state

UI15. Skeleton placeholders while loading.

### 4.8 Billing Profiles tab

UI17. The Billing Profiles tab MUST group models.dev rate records by `pricing_profile` and present a master-detail workbench.

UI17a. Desktop (`lg` and above) MUST render a left profile list and a right detail pane. The detail pane MUST show model ID plus input, cache-read, and output token prices formatted as USD per one million tokens.

UI17b. Mobile (`< lg`) MUST render a horizontally scrollable profile selector and stacked model-price rows. No pricing table may require horizontal page scrolling.

UI18. Billing Profiles MUST provide model search and source/status filters without exposing nano-USD units or raw JSON in the primary flow.

UI19. Billing Profiles MUST provide:

- a `Sync models.dev` action that calls `POST /api/dashboard/model-metadata/sync/models-dev`;
- a visible last-sync/source status derived from synchronized records;
- an ordered match-rule editor backed by `GET/PUT /api/dashboard/pricing-profile-patterns`;
- a manual-override action that creates or updates manual `billing_rate_records` using human-readable USD-per-million inputs.

UI19a. When metadata and billing rates have finished loading and no `models_dev` records exist, the UI MUST trigger at most one automatic models.dev sync for that mounted page instance. A failed automatic sync MUST show a retry action and MUST NOT loop.

UI19b. A successful models.dev sync MUST revalidate both model metadata and billing-rate SWR resources in the same interaction.

UI20. Manual overrides MUST be visually separated from synchronized rates. Manual rows take precedence through the existing rate priority and source semantics; deleting a manual override MUST reveal the synchronized value after SWR revalidation.

### 4.9 Advanced Rates tab

UI21. The Advanced Rates tab MUST list `billing_rate_records` with every low-level mutable field, including nano-USD and JSON match fields.

UI22. Advanced Rates MUST provide catalog sync, search, add, edit, and delete actions.

UI23. The low-level rate edit dialog MUST allow editing every mutable field exposed by the Billing-rate CRUD API. JSON fields MUST be edited as JSON text and rejected client-side when not valid JSON.

UI24. Empty pricing-profile match-rule `pattern` or `pricing_profile` values MUST be blocked before submitting.

### 4.8 Billing integration note

UI16. Billing resolves a normalized pricing key for `upstream_model` first. Pricing-key normalization MUST strip at most one recognized reasoning-tier suffix using the suffix rules in § 8. If a redirected normalized `upstream_model` key has no complete rates, billing MUST retry the lookup with the normalized logical-model key. Both lookups query `billing_rate_records` through the selected pricing profile.

## 5. Invariants

INV1. `source = 'manual'` whenever created or updated via PUT endpoint.

INV2. Sync MUST NOT modify records where `source = 'manual'`.

INV3. `model_id` is the primary key, bare model API name, MUST be unique.

INV4. Price fields are nullable. Billing **blocks** a request only when neither the normalized `upstream_model` pricing key nor the normalized redirected source logical-model pricing key resolves to complete input/output pricing.

## 6. Billing Enforcement

BE1. `build_monoize_attempts()` MUST filter out an attempt when both of the following are true:

- the normalized pricing key of `upstream_model` has no complete eligible rate matrix in `billing_rate_records`, and
- the normalized pricing key of the request logical model also has no complete eligible rate matrix in `billing_rate_records`.

BE2. If ALL attempts for a request are filtered out due to missing pricing, the system MUST return HTTP 403 with error code `model_pricing_required` and a message listing the blocked model name(s).

BE3. `maybe_charge_response()` MUST return an error (HTTP 403 `model_pricing_required`) only if both the normalized `upstream_model` pricing-key lookup and the normalized logical-model fallback lookup fail. This is a defense-in-depth check — BE1 should already prevent this path from being reached.

BE4. The Provider dashboard page MUST display a visible warning badge on any `ProviderCard` whose models include entries with no complete eligible rate matrix in `billing_rate_records`. The badge MUST show the count of unpriced models.

- `GET /api/dashboard/providers` MUST include `unpriced_model_count`, `unpriced_model_ids`, and `model_runtime_statuses` for each provider. `unpriced_model_ids` MUST contain exactly the logical model ids counted by `unpriced_model_count`, sorted ascending. Each `model_runtime_statuses` entry MUST expose its `pricing_status` and the Channel id and name for every unpriced mapping as defined by `channel-management.spec.md`.
- For a redirected entry, the card MUST treat the model as priced when either the normalized pricing key of the `redirect` model or the normalized pricing key of the logical model has complete rates. It MUST count the entry as unpriced only when both are missing/incomplete.

BE5. The billing enforcement check uses a per-request cache to avoid redundant pricing lookups. Because redirect fallback and suffix normalization depend on both `upstream_model` and logical model after pricing-key normalization, the cache key MUST include both values or an equivalent composite identity.

## 7. Model ID Normalization

NID1. **Canonical form**: `model_id` MUST be normalized in this order:
  1. Take the last segment after splitting on `/`.
  2. Optionally strip a provider prefix in either `provider--model` or `provider.model` form, but ONLY when `provider` is a known provider identifier.
  3. Lowercase the result.
  - `openai/gpt-4o` → `gpt-4o`
  - `accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v3p1-405b-instruct` → `llama-v3p1-405b-instruct`
  - `anthropic--claude-4.5-opus` → `claude-4.5-opus`
  - `xxxxx/anthropic.claude-opus-4.6` → `claude-opus-4.6`
  - `flux.1-dev` → `flux.1-dev` (no known provider prefix; preserve)
  - `GPT-4o` → `gpt-4o`
  - `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` → `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` (no `/`, unchanged except lowercase)

NID2. Normalization MUST be applied:
  - During `sync_from_models_dev`, when grouping variants by model name.
  - During migration on startup (existing records with `/` in `model_id`).

NID3. When normalization produces duplicate `model_id` values, the most recently updated record wins.

NID4. Dashboard CRUD routes for model metadata MUST use Axum wildcard `{*model_id}` to support model IDs that may contain `/` (e.g. user-created records). The handler MUST strip a leading `/` from the captured path if present.

## 8. Suffix-Based Reasoning Effort Resolution

### 8.1 Reasoning effort value domain

RE1. Valid `reasoning_effort` values: `none`, `minimum`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`. `xhigh` and `max` are two distinct effort levels and MUST NOT be aliased to each other.

RE2. The built-in suffix table maps each `-<effort>` suffix to its own identical effort string (e.g. `-max -> max`, `-xhigh -> xhigh`). Monoize MUST NOT collapse `-max` to `xhigh` at suffix-resolution time.

### 8.2 Global suffix → effort mapping

RE3. A global setting `reasoning_suffix_map` stores a JSON object mapping string suffixes to reasoning effort values.

Default value:
```json
{
  "-thinking": "high",
  "-reasoning": "high",
  "-nothinking": "none"
}
```

RE4. Suffixes are matched **longest-first** against the end of the model name.

RE5. The setting is stored in `system_settings` table under key `reasoning_suffix_map` and exposed via the existing `GET/PUT /api/dashboard/settings` endpoints.

RE5a. Startup and every successful settings mutation MUST publish `reasoning_suffix_map` into the process runtime snapshot. Forwarding suffix resolution MUST read that snapshot and MUST NOT query `system_settings` per request.

RE6. The setting is editable in the dashboard Settings page.

RE6a. The default provider-level suffix transform used for Anthropic/OpenRouter compatibility SHOULD map wildcard `*` to `-thinking` (not `-{effort}`), so suffix resolution keeps model IDs on supported aliases.

### 8.3 Model resolution algorithm

RE7. When `collect_provider_attempts` looks up `urp.model` in each `channel.models`:
  1. **Exact match**: If `channel.models` contains `urp.model`, use it directly. No suffix processing.
  2. **Suffix resolution**: If no exact match, iterate `reasoning_suffix_map` entries (longest suffix first). For each suffix, check if `urp.model` ends with that suffix. If yes:
     - `base_model = urp.model` with the suffix removed.
     - Look up `base_model` in `channel.models`.
     - If found, use that Channel model entry AND set `reasoning_effort` to the mapped value.
  3. **No match**: If neither exact nor suffix match, skip this Channel.

RE8. When a suffix match resolves to a base model, the resolved `reasoning_effort` value MUST be injected into the URP request's `reasoning.effort` field (typed flow) before the request is encoded for the upstream provider. If the user already specified `reasoning_effort` explicitly in the request body, the explicit value takes precedence over the suffix-derived value.

RE9. Billing and any other model-pricing identification path use the **base model**'s pricing from `model_metadata_records`. When a model ID ends with a recognized reasoning-tier suffix, Monoize MUST strip that suffix (longest suffix first, at most one suffix removed) before metadata lookup. The suffix model itself does not need a separate pricing entry.

### 8.4 Billing: reasoning token fallback

RE10. In `calculate_charge_nano`, when `reasoning_tokens > 0` and `output_cost_per_reasoning_token_nano` is `None`, the system MUST fall back to `output_cost_per_token_nano` for reasoning tokens (i.e. charge all completion tokens at the output rate).

This is already the existing behavior (the `else` branch charges `completion_tokens * output_cost_per_token_nano` which includes reasoning tokens). No change needed.

## 9. Migration

MIG1. On startup, existing records with `model_id` containing `/` (e.g. `openai/gpt-4o`) MUST be migrated to bare name via NID1 normalization. When duplicates arise after stripping, keep the most recently updated record.
