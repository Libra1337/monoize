# Playground Specification

## 0A. LynShen migration release

PG-MIG-1. The Playground remains authenticated and MUST use the authenticated
`GET /api/dashboard/marketplace/models` catalog. It MUST NOT use the public Marketplace
response as an authorization or routing catalog.

PG-MIG-2. The model catalog MUST include only mappings that are structurally eligible and
priced under `provider-pricing.spec.md`. A submitted model that has only unpriced mappings
MUST receive `403 model_pricing_required` without an upstream dispatch.

PG-MIG-3. The Playground request shape and API-key selection remain unchanged. It MUST NOT
ask a user to choose a Channel because one Provider has exactly one embedded Channel.

## 0. Status

- Product name: Monoize.
- Scope: ephemeral chatbot playground accessible at `/dashboard/playground`.
- The Playground supports an internal session credential and explicit user API keys.

## 1. Purpose

The Playground is a session-only chatbot for the local Monoize instance. It supports
streamed chat completions, multimodal user attachments, image generation, and image
editing through the Monoize forwarding endpoints. Conversation state is a frontend-only
feature and is never persisted to any backend store. Forwarding authentication is supplied
by either the authenticated dashboard session or a user-selected API key.

## 2. Session and Persistence Model

PG-STATE1. The conversation (all messages, attachments, and generated images) MUST live
only in browser memory (React state). The frontend MUST NOT send conversation history to
any Monoize dashboard endpoint and MUST NOT write conversation history to `localStorage`,
`sessionStorage`, IndexedDB, or cookies. A page reload starts an empty conversation.

PG-STATE2. Exactly these preference keys MAY be persisted in `localStorage`:

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `playground_group` | string | Selected routing group id; empty/absent means "auto". |
| `playground_chat_model` | string | Selected chat model id. |
| `playground_image_model` | string | Selected image model id. |
| `playground_image_size` | string | Selected image size as `<width>x<height>`. Empty/absent means `auto`. |
| `playground_api_key_id` | string | Explicitly selected API-key id; empty/absent means the built-in Playground credential. |
| `playground_temperature` | string | Decimal string; empty/absent means "omit from request". |
| `playground_max_tokens` | string | Integer string; empty/absent means "omit from request". |
| `playground_system_prompt` | string | System prompt text; empty means "no system message". |

PG-STATE3. On first mount the page MUST delete the legacy keys `playground_api_key` and
`playground_model` from `localStorage`. The Playground MUST NOT persist a full API-key
secret. Persisting the selected API-key id per PG-STATE2 is permitted.

## 3. Authentication

PG-AUTH1. Dashboard API keys, groups, marketplace models, and the session user MUST be
fetched with the authenticated dashboard session through `useApiKeys`,
`useDashboardGroups`, `useMarketplaceModels`, and `useCurrentUser`. The Playground MUST
NOT create or mutate API keys.

PG-AUTH2. Credential selection has exactly two modes:

1. If `playground_api_key_id` is empty, the effective credential is the built-in
   Playground credential.
2. If `playground_api_key_id = k`, the effective credential is the user's API key whose
   id equals `k`. The frontend MUST NOT replace `k` with another API key automatically.
3. If `k` does not identify a time-eligible API key after the API-key response loads, the
   frontend MUST clear `playground_api_key_id` and return to the built-in credential.

PG-AUTH3. A built-in forwarding request (`/api/v1/chat/completions`,
`/api/v1/images/generations`, or `/api/v1/images/edits`) MUST omit `Authorization` and
`x-api-key`, include browser credentials, and send
`x-monoize-internal-source: playground`. When a non-auto routing group is selected, the
request MUST also send `x-monoize-playground-group: <group-id>`.

PG-AUTH4. The forwarding server MUST accept `x-monoize-internal-source: playground` only
when no API-key credential is present and the `monoize_session` HttpOnly cookie identifies
an enabled dashboard user. The resulting authentication object MUST have `api_key_id =
null`, `api_key_name = null`, and internal source `playground`. No API-key row, token,
secret, prefix, or identifier is created for this authentication mode.

PG-AUTH5. An explicit API-key forwarding request MUST authenticate with
`Authorization: Bearer <full-key-value>`, where the value comes from the selected
dashboard API-key record. It MUST omit `x-monoize-internal-source` and
`x-monoize-playground-group`; the normal API-key authentication, billing, routing,
transforms, redirects, allowlists, multiplier ceiling, and request-capture rules apply.

PG-AUTH6. An API key is *time-eligible* iff `enabled == true` and `expires_at` is absent,
invalid, or in the future at evaluation time. A time-eligible key is *model-compatible*
with selected model id `m` iff `m` is empty, `model_limits_enabled == false`,
`model_limits == []`, or `m ∈ model_limits`. A time-eligible key *covers* an explicit
selected group `g` iff one condition is true:

1. `group_ids == []`.
2. `g ∈ group_ids`.

PG-AUTH7. When an explicit API key is not model-compatible or does not cover the selected
non-auto group, sending MUST be disabled and an inline translated reason MUST identify
the incompatible model or group. The selected key id MUST remain unchanged. The frontend
MUST NOT silently fall back to the built-in credential or another API key.

PG-AUTH8. For a built-in auto-group request, the effective routing group list MUST equal
the session user's current group after the billing-plan group ceiling is applied. For a
built-in explicit-group request, the effective routing group list MUST equal only that
group after the same billing-plan ceiling is applied.

PG-AUTH9. For a built-in request, an explicit group is permitted iff the group exists and
at least one condition is true: the session user is an administrator, the group has
`user_selectable = true`, or the group id equals the session user's current group id. A
non-permitted group MUST return HTTP `403` before upstream dispatch. A group removed by a
non-empty enabled billing-plan group ceiling MUST return HTTP `403` before upstream
dispatch.

PG-AUTH10. Playground internal authentication MUST bill the session user's main balance.
It MUST NOT enable API-key sub-account billing, model allowlists, key transforms, key model
redirects, key IP allowlists, key multiplier ceilings, or key request capture.

PG-AUTH11. Built-in Playground requests MUST be admitted to the normal request-log
lifecycle with `request_kind = "playground"`. This classification is metadata; it is not
an API key and MUST NOT be accepted as an API-key credential. Requests authenticated by a
real API key MUST use the normal API-key request-log identity and MUST NOT use
`request_kind = "playground"`.

PG-AUTH12. The composer toolbar MUST render the credential picker as an independent
shadcn `DropdownMenu`. The picker MUST NOT be nested inside the settings popover. Its
trigger MUST identify the selected credential. Its first option is the translated
built-in Playground credential and represents `playground_api_key_id = ""`. It MUST then
list every time-eligible API key in API response order with its name and masked
`key_prefix`. The built-in option is selected by default. The picker MUST NOT show full
API-key values and MUST NOT contain an automatic-key-resolution option. The dropdown
content MAY scroll vertically, but an option list inside the content MUST NOT create a
second scrolling surface.

## 4. Selectors

PG-SEL1. The composer MUST contain compact popover selectors (shadcn `Popover` +
`Command`) for: routing group, chat model, and — while image mode is active — image
model. Selectors MUST NOT be free-text-only inputs.

PG-SEL2. Group selector:

- Options are "auto" plus every `Group` from `GET /api/dashboard/groups` that satisfies
  PG-AUTH9 and the enabled billing-plan group ceiling, in response order.
- Each option MUST use `Group.id` as its value and render `Group.name` as its label.
- Selection persists the group id to `playground_group` (empty string for "auto").
- If a non-empty persisted id does not match a returned `Group.id`, the page MUST clear
  it to "auto" after the group response loads.

PG-SEL3. Model selectors:

- The option list is `GET /api/dashboard/marketplace/models` (`useMarketplaceModels`).
- Each option row MUST render the model id with its provider icon (same icon resolution
  as `ModelBadge`).
- The selector MUST provide text search over model ids.
- When the search text is non-empty and does not exactly match an option, the list MUST
  include a "use custom id" entry that selects the typed text verbatim (the routable
  model set can exceed the metadata set).
- Chat model persists to `playground_chat_model`; image model persists to
  `playground_image_model`.

PG-SEL4. Image-model classification: a marketplace record is an *image model* iff its
`mode` contains the substring `image` (case-insensitive) or its lowercased `model_id`
contains at least one of:

`dall-e`, `dalle`, `gpt-image`, `flux`, `stable-diffusion`, `sdxl`, `sd3`, `imagen`,
`seedream`, `seededit`, `kolors`, `ideogram`, `recraft`, `cogview`, `qwen-image`,
`hunyuan-image`, `nano-banana`, `janus`, `hidream`.

The image-model selector MUST list image models in a group before all remaining models.
The chat-model selector lists all models unsegmented.

PG-SEL5. While either composer-selector backing hook (`useDashboardGroups` or
`useMarketplaceModels`) is loading with no cached data, the corresponding selector trigger
MUST render as a skeleton pill instead of an interactive control. While `useApiKeys` is
loading with no cached data, the credential picker MUST keep the built-in option available
and render a skeleton in place of API-key rows.

PG-SEL6. Image mode MUST render one compact shadcn `Popover` trigger for the output image
size. The control MUST be hidden in chat mode. The trigger MUST show `auto` when
`playground_image_size` is empty. Otherwise, it MUST show the selected width and height.
The popover MUST contain separate width and height controls. Each dimension control MUST
contain a shadcn `Slider` and a numeric `Input`. Each dimension MUST accept every integer
from 256 through 4096 pixels. Each slider MUST use a 64-pixel step. Changing either
dimension MUST store `<width>x<height>` in `playground_image_size`. The `auto` action MUST
store an empty value. An invalid persisted value MUST resolve to `auto` and MUST NOT reach
an image request.

## 5. Chat Execution (AI SDK)

PG-CHAT1. Chat state MUST be managed by `useChat` from `@ai-sdk/react` with a custom
`ChatTransport` implementation (`MonoizeChatTransport`). The transport MUST NOT be the
default HTTP transport.

PG-CHAT2. `MonoizeChatTransport.sendMessages` MUST:

1. Read the current chat model id, selected credential, selected group id, system prompt,
   temperature, and max-tokens values at call time (latest selector state applies to every
   request, including regenerations).
2. Reject with an error carrying a translatable reason when the model is empty.
3. Build an OpenAI-compatible provider via `createOpenAICompatible` from
   `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` with `baseURL = <origin>/api/v1`. Built-in mode MUST use
   the PG-AUTH3 headers, no `apiKey`, and a fetch implementation with `credentials =
   "include"`. Explicit API-key mode MUST use `apiKey = <full-key-value>` and omit the
   internal headers. In both modes the upstream call is
   `POST /api/v1/chat/completions` with `stream: true` against the local Monoize
   instance.
4. Convert UI messages with `convertToModelMessages` after applying PG-CHAT3
   sanitation.
5. Call `streamText` with: the converted messages; `system` set iff the stored system
   prompt is non-empty; `temperature` set iff `playground_temperature` parses as a
   finite number; `maxOutputTokens` set iff `playground_max_tokens` parses as a positive
   integer; and the abort signal from the chat.
6. Return `toUIMessageStream(...)` of the resulting stream with an `onError` mapper
   that maps the failure to human-readable text (upstream error text must reach the
   UI): an `Error` maps to its `message`; a non-Error object maps to its string
   `message` field, else its nested `error.message` string field, else its JSON
   serialization; any other value maps to `String(value)`.

PG-CHAT3. Outgoing-message sanitation: `file` parts of **assistant** messages MUST be
excluded from the converted model messages. If exclusion leaves an assistant message
with no parts, one text part with literal content `[image]` MUST be substituted.
User-message `file` parts MUST be preserved (they encode user image attachments).

PG-CHAT4. Send/stop contract: while `status` is `submitted` or `streaming`, the primary
composer action MUST be a stop control invoking `stop()`. Stopping keeps all partial
assistant output as a normal message and MUST NOT surface an error.

PG-CHAT5. When `useChat` reports an `error`, an inline dismissible banner MUST appear
between the message list and the composer showing the error message, with a retry action
that calls `regenerate()` and a dismiss action that calls `clearError()`. No toast is
shown for chat request errors.

PG-CHAT6. User attachments: chat mode accepts images and ordinary files. Send MUST call
`sendMessage({ text, files })` so attachments become user-message `file` parts with their
original media type, file name, and data URL. Image mode accepts image files only because
its edit endpoint requires an image source.

## 6. Message Operations

PG-MSG1. Every message exposes hover/focus actions. Minimum set: copy (all roles with
text), edit (user and assistant), delete (all roles). Assistant messages additionally
expose regenerate, and each assistant image exposes download and edit-image actions.
For an assistant message with an image, all actions MUST render in one non-wrapping
toolbar below the image. The UI MUST NOT render a separate second message-action row.
On coarse-pointer devices the actions MUST be reachable without hover (always visible)
with touch targets per `frontend-design-system.spec.md` DS49.

PG-MSG2. Edit is inline: the message body is replaced by a textarea initialized with the
concatenated text parts, with confirm and cancel actions. Preconditions: `status` is
`ready` or `error`.

PG-MSG3. Confirming a **user** message edit MUST call
`sendMessage({ text: <edited>, messageId })`, which replaces that message, removes all
later messages, and requests a new assistant response. If the original message contains
`file` parts, the call MUST also pass those parts through `files`. Each file MUST preserve
its original media type, file name, URL, provider reference, and provider metadata.

PG-MSG4. Confirming an **assistant** message edit MUST replace the message's text parts
with a single text part containing the edited text via `setMessages`, in place, without
issuing any request.

PG-MSG5. Delete MUST remove exactly the targeted message via `setMessages` filtering,
without issuing any request. The optimistic update is the operation itself (client-only
state); no rollback path exists.

PG-MSG6. Regenerate on an assistant message that was not created by PG-IMG5 MUST call
`regenerate({ messageId })`. This removes that assistant message and everything after it,
then requests a new text response with the current selector state.

## 7. Image Generation and Editing

PG-IMG1. The composer has a chat/image mode toggle. Mode is session state (not
persisted). While image mode is active the image-model selector is visible and the send
action executes an image request instead of a chat request.

PG-IMG2. Image send with no attachment MUST call
`POST /api/v1/images/generations` with JSON body
`{ "model": <image model>, "prompt": <composer text>, "n": 1 }` and the credentials and
headers selected by PG-AUTH2 through PG-AUTH5. If the selected image size is explicit,
the body MUST also contain `"size": <selected image size>`. If the selected image size is
`auto`, the body MUST omit `size`.

PG-IMG3. Image send with at least one attachment MUST call
`POST /api/v1/images/edits` as `multipart/form-data` with fields `model`, `prompt`,
`n = 1`, and `image` = the first attachment file. Additional attachments beyond the
first are ignored for the upstream call (the endpoint accepts a single source image).
If the selected image size is explicit, the form MUST also contain `size` with its literal
value. If the selected image size is `auto`, the form MUST omit `size`. The request MUST
use the credentials and headers selected by PG-AUTH2 through PG-AUTH5.

PG-IMG4. On image send the frontend MUST synchronously append a user message (prompt
text plus attachment file parts) to the chat state, and render a pending assistant
placeholder with an animated loading treatment until the request settles.

PG-IMG5. On success, the placeholder MUST be replaced by an assistant message whose
parts are, in order: one text part with `revised_prompt` when present, then one `file`
part per `data[]` entry — `url` used verbatim when present, otherwise
`data:image/png;base64,<b64_json>`. The frontend MUST retain the request input in memory,
keyed by the generated assistant message id, until the conversation is cleared.

PG-IMG6. On failure, the placeholder MUST be replaced by an inline error state with a
retry action that re-issues the same request. The user message remains in the
conversation.

PG-IMG6a. Regenerate on an assistant message created by PG-IMG5 MUST remove that
assistant message and all later messages. It MUST then re-issue the retained image request
through `/api/v1/images/generations` or `/api/v1/images/edits`, according to whether the
retained request has an attachment. It MUST NOT call the text-generation transport or
append a second user message.

PG-IMG7. Image requests MUST be abortable through the same stop control (an
`AbortController` scoped to the in-flight image request). Aborting removes the pending
placeholder and keeps the user message; no error is shown.

PG-IMG8. The edit-image action on a generated (or attached) image MUST switch the
composer to image mode and stage that image as the composer attachment, so the next send
follows PG-IMG3. If fetching the image bytes for staging fails, an error toast is shown
and the composer state is unchanged.

PG-IMG9. Generated images participate in later chat requests only through PG-CHAT3
(assistant file parts are stripped); the image bytes are never re-uploaded in chat mode.

## 8. Composer

PG-CMP1. The composer is a single bordered surface containing, top to bottom: the
attachment preview row (when attachments exist), the auto-growing textarea (1 to 8 lines),
and a control row with the selectors (PG-SEL1), the attach action, the mode toggle, the
settings popover trigger, and the send/stop action.

PG-CMP2. Enter submits and Shift+Enter inserts a newline on fine-pointer devices. On
coarse-pointer devices Enter inserts a newline and only the send button submits.

PG-CMP3. Send is enabled iff: a model for the active mode is selected, the selected
credential satisfies PG-AUTH2 and PG-AUTH7, `status` is `ready`/`error`, no image request
is pending, and the trimmed text is non-empty (chat mode also allows empty text with ≥ 1
attachment).

PG-CMP4. The settings popover contains: system prompt (multiline), temperature (number,
range 0–2, step 0.1, clearable), max tokens (positive integer, clearable), and the
credential picker from PG-AUTH12. Each field persists per PG-STATE2 on change. The
popover MUST align its end edge to the trigger, prefer opening above the trigger, keep at
least 16 CSS pixels from every viewport edge, and use internal vertical scrolling when its
content exceeds the collision-computed available height.

PG-CMP5. A "new chat" action MUST be visible whenever the conversation is non-empty; it
clears the chat state, any pending image job, and composer attachments. It MUST NOT
clear persisted preferences.

PG-CMP6. The Playground root MUST accept attachment files from all three input paths:
the file-picker action, a file drag-and-drop anywhere inside the page, and a clipboard
paste event whose clipboard contains one or more files. A clipboard paste without files
MUST preserve normal textarea text paste behavior. All three paths MUST apply PG-CHAT6's
mode restriction. Switching from chat mode to image mode MUST remove staged non-image
files. Each staged image MUST render an image thumbnail; each staged non-image file MUST
render a file icon and its truncated file name. Every staged attachment MUST expose the
same remove action.

## 9. Layout

PG-L1. The page renders inside the standard dashboard shell (sidebar navigation entry
retained). The playground content root MUST be a full-height flex column sized so the
page itself never scrolls: height `calc(100dvh - 5.5rem)` below `lg` and
`calc(100dvh - 3rem)` at `lg` and above (the dashboard main pane paddings).

PG-L2. Empty conversation renders a hero: centered greeting text (display font) with a
one-line muted hint stating that the chat is ephemeral, and the composer centered
beneath it, with no card wrapper. Non-empty conversation renders the scrollable message
list (the only scroll container) with the composer docked at the bottom and a "new
chat" action above the list (PG-CMP5). Both states share one composer element.

PG-L3. Message column max width MUST be `48rem` (`max-w-3xl`) centered. User messages
render as right-aligned bubbles on the `muted` surface token with `rounded-2xl` corners;
assistant messages render full-width on the page surface without a bubble. No purple or
violet styling is introduced; all colors come from existing theme tokens.

PG-L4. While streaming or waiting, the list MUST follow the newest content
(auto-scroll), and auto-scroll MUST pause when the user has scrolled up more than
`80px` from the bottom, resuming when they return to the bottom.

## 10. Rendering

PG-RD1. Assistant text parts MUST render through the `streamdown` package's
`Streamdown` component (streaming-safe markdown with incomplete-block handling). User
text parts render as plain text preserving whitespace.

PG-RD2. Assistant reasoning parts MUST render as a collapsed, expandable muted section
labeled through i18n, separate from the answer text.

PG-RD3. `file` parts with an `image` media type render as rounded images constrained to
the message column (max height `24rem`), with the PG-MSG1 image actions.

PG-RD4. A user-message `file` part with a non-image media type MUST render as a compact
downloadable file row containing a file icon and the original file name. It MUST NOT be
passed to an image element.

## 11. Motion

PG-MO1. All animations use `framer-motion` with the shared spring presets from
`components/ui/motion.tsx`; reduced-motion behavior follows
`frontend-design-system.spec.md` DS32–DS34 (no x/y/scale animation when reduced motion
is on).

PG-MO2. Message entry animates opacity `0 → 1`, y `12px → 0`, scale `0.98 → 1` with a
spring (stiffness 300–500, damping 24–35). Message removal animates opacity `1 → 0` and
scale `1 → 0.96` inside `AnimatePresence` with `mode="popLayout"`, and surviving
siblings reflow via `layout` animation.

PG-MO3. The composer is a `layout`-animated element shared between the hero and docked
positions (PG-L2); the hero-to-docked transition MUST animate with a spring rather than
jumping.

PG-MO4. The chat/image mode toggle MUST animate its active indicator with a shared
`layoutId` spring. The send/stop icon swap animates scale/opacity.

PG-MO5. The pending assistant state renders an animated indicator (pulsing dot or
shimmer). All indicator animation must be opacity-only under reduced motion.

## 12. Internationalization

PG-I18N1. All user-visible copy uses i18n keys under the `playground` namespace, present
in `en.json`, `zh.json`, `zh-TW.json`, and `ja.json`.

## 13. Constraints

PG-C1. The Playground performs no dashboard configuration mutation.

PG-C2. The Playground MUST NOT implement its own SSE parser for chat; streaming is
handled by the AI SDK provider/`streamText` pipeline (PG-CHAT2).

PG-C3. The page MUST be split into multiple components under
`frontend/src/components/playground/`; the route file composes them.
