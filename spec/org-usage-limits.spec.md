# Organization Usage Limits and Member Analytics Specification

## 0. Status

- Purpose: spend limits for organization spaces at three levels (space, member, key) with
  total / hourly / daily windows, plus a per-member usage analysis inside a space.
- Scope: `orgs` limit columns, `org_members` limit columns, `api_keys` limit columns,
  settlement-time enforcement, `GET /api/dashboard/orgs/{org_id}/member-usage`,
  `PUT /api/dashboard/orgs/{org_id}/limits`, `PUT /api/dashboard/orgs/{org_id}/keys/{key_id}/limits`.
- Related: `orgs.spec.md` (spaces), `metered-billing.spec.md` (settlement),
  `dashboard-usage-analysis.spec.md` (response shapes).

## 1. Data model

ORGL-1. `orgs` gains four nullable limit columns. NULL means unlimited. Each value is a
non-negative integer amount in nano-USD:

- `spend_limit_total_nano_usd` — lifetime spend of the whole space, measured from the
  durable `request_logs` attribution (`user_id = org_id`);
- `spend_limit_hourly_nano_usd` — rolling window of the last 3600 seconds;
- `spend_limit_daily_nano_usd` — calendar-day window by UTC day;
- `spend_limit_daily_reset_at` — server-side bookkeeping (see ORGL-9); NULL.

ORGL-2. `org_members` gains the same three nullable limit columns
(`spend_limit_total_nano_usd`, `spend_limit_hourly_nano_usd`,
`spend_limit_daily_nano_usd`). A member limit constrains the spend attributed to that
member inside this space: request-log rows with `user_id = org_id` and
`api_key_id IN (keys whose org_id = this org AND created_by = this member)`.

ORGL-3. `api_keys` carries the same three nullable limit columns
(`spend_limit_total_nano_usd`, `spend_limit_hourly_nano_usd`,
`spend_limit_daily_nano_usd`) for every key. A key limit constrains
request-log rows with `api_key_id = this key`. For org keys the key level
sits under the space and member levels (ORGL-4); for personal keys
(`org_id IS NULL`) the key level is the only level that applies.

ORGL-4. All three levels evaluate independently. A request is admitted only when every
configured limit at every applicable level passes. Example: a key with a 1 USD hourly
limit inside a member with a 2 USD hourly limit inside a space with a 10 USD hourly limit
rejects once any one of the three windows is exhausted.

## 2. Enforcement

ORGL-5. Enforcement happens at settlement time in `maybe_charge_usage_with_output`
(after the charge is computed, before the wallet is debited) and at the admission
preflight (`ensure_balance_before_forward`) for fast rejection. Both points MUST evaluate
the same limit set. A breached limit aborts with HTTP `402 org_spend_limit_reached` and
message naming the breached level (`space` | `member` | `key`) and window
(`total` | `hourly` | `daily`).

ORGL-6. Window spend is the sum of `charge_nano_usd` over the durable attribution:
`total` = every row with the attribution of ORGL-1/2/3; `hourly` = rows with
`created_at >= now - 3600s`; `daily` = rows with `created_at >= start of the current UTC
day`. Failed requests (`status != 'success'`) contribute zero charge and never breach a
limit. Charges are nano-USD integers; comparisons are `>=`.

ORGL-7. The admission preflight uses the same queries. It is advisory-fast (read pool)
and MUST NOT block on the write path; a race between preflight and settlement is closed
by the settlement check, which is authoritative. A request that already streamed a
response body and then breaches at settlement records a normal request-log row with its
charge; the wallet is still debited; subsequent requests are rejected until the window
rolls over. (Fail-open at the tail is deliberate: an upstream token already consumed
cannot be returned.)

ORGL-8. Space- and member-level limit checks run only for org-key traffic
(`api_keys.org_id IS NOT NULL`). Key-level checks run for every key that has
at least one configured window, personal keys included. Personal-key traffic
is otherwise untouched. Sub-account keys follow the existing sub-account
rules first; spend limits apply on top.

ORGL-9. `spend_limit_daily_reset_at` records the UTC midnight the daily window last
rolled over for display purposes ("resets at ..."). It is derived from `created_at` and
requires no writer.

## 3. Management API

ORGL-10. `PUT /api/dashboard/orgs/{org_id}/limits` (owner only) sets the space-level
limits and per-member limits in one call:

```json
{
  "space": {"total_nano_usd": null, "hourly_nano_usd": "5000000000", "daily_nano_usd": null},
  "members": {"{member_user_id}": {"hourly_nano_usd": "1000000000"}}
}
```

Absent keys and `null` mean "leave unchanged" for members and "clear (unlimited)" when
explicitly null inside a provided object. Clearing a limit MUST store SQL NULL, never an
empty string. A stored empty string (written by builds before this rule) MUST read as
NULL (unlimited) everywhere a limit column is parsed. Values MUST be integers >= 0 as
string or number; a negative or non-numeric value returns `400 invalid_request`. The
owner cannot set a limit on the owner's own member row (the owner is not a consumer of
the org wallet through member keys; owner spending is the wallet itself and is governed
by the space limits and the wallet balance).

ORGL-11. `PUT /api/dashboard/orgs/{org_id}/keys/{key_id}/limits` (owner, or the key's
creator) sets the key-level limits with the same body shape
(`{"total_nano_usd": ..., "hourly_nano_usd": ..., "daily_nano_usd": ...}`).

ORGL-12. `GET /api/dashboard/orgs/{org_id}/limits` (owner only) returns the current
limit set with live consumption per limit:

```json
{
  "space": {"total_nano_usd": null, "hourly_nano_usd": "5000000000", "daily_nano_usd": null,
            "spent": {"total_nano_usd": "123456789", "hourly_nano_usd": "420000000",
                      "daily_nano_usd": "980000000"}},
  "members": [{"user_id": "...", "username": "...", "limits": {...}, "spent": {...}}],
  "keys": [{"key_id": "...", "name": "...", "limits": {...}, "spent": {...}}]
}
```

## 4. Member usage analysis

ORGL-13. `GET /api/dashboard/orgs/{org_id}/member-usage?range_hours={1..720}&buckets={1..48}`
(owner only) returns per-member usage inside the space over request-log rows with
`user_id = {org_id}`, grouped by the key's `created_by`:

```json
{
  "range_hours": 24, "buckets": 24,
  "members": [
    {"user_id": "...", "username": "...", "role": "member",
     "total_charge_nano_usd": "...", "calls": 12, "input_tokens": 100, "output_tokens": 200,
     "cache_read_tokens": 50,
     "by_model": [{"model": "m", "charge_nano_usd": "...", "calls": 3, "input_tokens": 1, "output_tokens": 2}],
     "series": [{"bucket_start": "RFC3339", "charge_nano_usd": "...", "calls": 1}]}
  ],
  "removed_members": [
    {"user_id": "...", "username": "...", "total_charge_nano_usd": "...", "calls": 4}
  ]
}
```

- `members` covers current members plus any `created_by` value that still has rows in the
  range, so usage from since-removed members is visible in `removed_members` (rows whose
  `created_by` no longer has an `org_members` row).
- Rows whose key has no `created_by` (system-created) attribute to the owner.
- Token fields sum the corresponding request-log columns; `calls` counts success rows.

ORGL-14. `/org/{org_id}` gains a "Member usage" view (owner only) rendering ORGL-13 with
a range selector (1h/24h/7d/30d) and a per-member bar series, plus a "Limits" management
view rendering ORGL-12 with editable forms for ORGL-10/11.

## 5. Invariants

ORGL-15. Limits never rewrite history: consumption is computed from durable
`request_logs`, so removing members or deleting keys (ORG-17/17b) leaves both the limit
baselines and the analytics unchanged.

ORGL-16. Setting a limit below already-spent consumption is allowed and takes effect
immediately: the next request breaches and is rejected.

ORGL-17. Limit queries MUST use the read pool and the existing
`idx_request_logs_org` (user_id, created_at_unix_ms) / `idx_request_logs_api_key_created` (api_key_id, created_at_unix_ms) indexes; a limit check adds at most three indexed
aggregations per request and MUST NOT add a write on the request path.

## 6. Editor currency

ORGL-20. Every limit editor — the org Limits view (ORGL-14) at the space, member, and
key levels, and the personal-key create/edit dialog — offers a USD/CNY input toggle.
Drafts hold display strings in the chosen currency; conversion to the canonical
nano-USD storage happens once, at save time: a USD amount maps directly, a CNY amount
divides by the live `cny_per_usd` snapshot (the same exact-decimal contract as the
wallet CNY top-up) and the editor shows the rate it will use. Stored windows remain
nano-USD; enforcement (ORGL-5..7, ORGL-19) is unchanged. Switching the toggle
re-derives the displayed drafts from the stored nano values through the current rate.
When no rate snapshot is available the CNY option is disabled with an explanatory
message.

## 7. Personal keys

ORGL-18. A personal key (`org_id IS NULL`) sets its three key-level windows through
the ordinary Token Management create and update endpoints
(`POST /api/dashboard/keys`, `PUT /api/dashboard/keys/{key_id}`) with the fields
`spend_limit_total_nano_usd`, `spend_limit_hourly_nano_usd`,
`spend_limit_daily_nano_usd`. Values are canonical non-negative integer nano-USD
strings. On create, an absent or null field means unlimited. On update the fields are
tri-state: absent keeps the stored value; null or the empty string clears it (SQL
NULL, never an empty string); a value sets it. The key's owner and admins may set
them; an org key's windows are set only through ORGL-11.

ORGL-19. A personal-key breach aborts with HTTP `402 api_key_spend_limit_reached`
and a message naming the window (`total` | `hourly` | `daily`), at the same two
enforcement points and with the same fail-open settlement semantics as ORGL-5 and
ORGL-7. The key list/detail responses expose the three fields.
