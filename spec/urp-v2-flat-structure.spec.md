# URP v2 Flat Structure Specification

## 0. Status

- Version: `2.0.0`
- Product name: Monoize
- Internal protocol name: `URP v2`
- Scope: canonical flat request and response storage, canonical flat streaming events, unknown-field passthrough, cross-family nested-field stripping, control-node semantics, and downstream envelope reconstruction invariants.

## 1. Terminology

- **Node sequence**: An ordered array of URP v2 `Node` values.
- **Ordinary node**: A role-bearing top-level node that represents one conversational, media, refusal, reasoning, tool-call, or provider-item unit.
- **ToolResult node**: A distinct top-level node that represents one completed tool result correlated by `call_id`.
- **Control node**: A top-level node with no user-visible content. In this spec the only control node kind is `next_downstream_envelope_extra`.
- **Consumable envelope**: One concrete downstream protocol object created by an encoder from one or more consecutive URP nodes. Examples include one Responses `message` item, one Chat Completions `message`, one Anthropic `message`, or one Anthropic `tool_result` block container.
- **Protocol family**: One of these exact families:
  - `responses`: downstream `/v1/responses` or upstream provider type `responses`
  - `chat_completion`: downstream `/v1/chat/completions` or upstream provider type `chat_completion`
  - `messages`: downstream `/v1/messages` or upstream provider type `messages`
- **Cross-family hop**: Any encode step whose source family differs from its target family. Any hop involving `gemini` or `openai_image` is cross-family.
- **Provider protocol**: One of `responses`, `chat_completion`, `messages`, `gemini`, `openai_image`, or `replicate`.
- **Same-protocol hop**: An encode step whose target provider protocol exactly equals the source protocol recorded on an opaque provider item.

## 2. Canonical non-stream objects

URPV2-1. The canonical internal request object MUST be:

```text
UrpRequestV2 {
  model: String,
  input: Vec<Node>,
  stream?: bool,
  temperature?: number,
  top_p?: number,
  max_output_tokens?: integer,
  reasoning?: ReasoningConfig,
  tools?: Vec<ToolDefinition>,
  tool_choice?: ToolChoice,
  stop?: StopControl,
  verbosity?: String,
  response_format?: ResponseFormat,
  user?: String,
  ...extra_body
}
```

URPV2-2. The canonical internal response object MUST be:

```text
UrpResponseV2 {
  id: String,
  model: String,
  output: Vec<Node>,
  finish_reason?: FinishReason,
  usage?: Usage,
  ...extra_body
}
```

URPV2-3. `input` and `output` MUST be ordered `Vec<Node>` sequences. Node order is canonical.

URPV2-4. `Message { role, parts }` is not a URP v2 value and MUST NOT appear in canonical storage.

URPV2-5. A decoder, transform, or encoder MUST NOT infer a canonical grouped message boundary from adjacency alone. Grouping exists only inside the encoder that is building one concrete downstream protocol object.

URPV2-6. Top-level request and response objects MUST support unknown-field passthrough through flattened `extra_body`.

URPV2-7. If a key exists in both a typed top-level field and top-level `extra_body`, the typed field value MUST win.

URPV2-8. The flat redesign changes only canonical conversational storage. `usage`, `finish_reason`, model selection fields, and top-level request controls remain top-level request or response fields and are not represented as nodes.

URPV2-8a. `UrpRequestV2.stop` MUST be a typed `StopControl` with exactly one of these shapes:

- `Single(String)` for a Chat Completions scalar `stop` value;
- `Multiple(Vec<String>)` for a Chat Completions array `stop` value or a Messages `stop_sequences` array.

A Chat request decoder MUST preserve whether the source used the scalar or array shape. A Messages request decoder MUST use `Multiple`. A Chat encoder MUST emit `Single` as a JSON string and `Multiple` as a JSON string array. A Messages encoder MUST emit `Single(s)` as `stop_sequences = [s]` and `Multiple(values)` as `stop_sequences = values`. A Responses encoder MUST omit `stop` because Responses create has no equivalent request control.

URPV2-8b. `UrpRequestV2.verbosity` is the typed OpenAI verbosity string. A Chat request decoder MUST read top-level `verbosity`. A Responses request decoder MUST read `text.verbosity`. Chat and Responses encoders MUST emit the corresponding native field. A Messages encoder MUST omit `verbosity` because Messages create has no equivalent request control.

URPV2-8c. `UrpRequestV2.user` owns the semantic caller identifier. Chat and Responses decoders MUST read top-level `user`; a Messages decoder MUST read `metadata.user_id`. Chat and Responses encoders MUST emit top-level `user`; a Messages encoder MUST emit `metadata.user_id`. A Messages decoder MUST preserve every non-`user_id` member of the source `metadata` object in `extra_body.metadata`. A Messages encoder MUST merge those preserved members into the emitted `metadata` object. If typed `user` and `extra_body.metadata.user_id` collide, typed `user` MUST win.

## 3. Canonical node model

URPV2-9. `Node` MUST be the discriminated union below.

```text
Node =
  | Text {
      type: "text",
      id?: String,
      role: OrdinaryRole,
      content: String,
      phase?: String,
      ...extra_body
    }
  | Image {
      type: "image",
      id?: String,
      role: OrdinaryRole,
      source: ImageSource,
      ...extra_body
    }
  | Audio {
      type: "audio",
      id?: String,
      role: OrdinaryRole,
      source: AudioSource,
      ...extra_body
    }
  | File {
      type: "file",
      id?: String,
      role: OrdinaryRole,
      source: FileSource,
      ...extra_body
    }
  | Refusal {
      type: "refusal",
      id?: String,
      role: "assistant",
      content: String,
      ...extra_body
    }
  | Reasoning {
      type: "reasoning",
      id?: String,
      role: "assistant",
      content?: String,
      summary?: String,
      encrypted?: JsonValue,
      source?: String,
      ...extra_body
    }
  | ToolCall {
      type: "tool_call",
      id?: String,
      role: "assistant",
      tool_type: "function" | "custom",
      call_id: String,
      name: String,
      arguments: String,
      ...extra_body
    }
  | ProviderItem {
      type: "provider_item",
      id?: String,
      origin_protocol: ProviderProtocol,
      role: OrdinaryRole,
      item_type: String,
      body: JsonValue,
      ...extra_body
    }
  | ToolResult {
      type: "tool_result",
      id?: String,
      tool_type: "function" | "custom",
      call_id: String,
      is_error?: bool,
      content: Vec<ToolResultContent>,
      ...extra_body
    }
  | NextDownstreamEnvelopeExtra {
      type: "next_downstream_envelope_extra",
      ...extra_body
    }
```

URPV2-10. `OrdinaryRole` MUST be one of `system`, `developer`, `user`, or `assistant`.

URPV2-11. `tool` is not an ordinary role in URP v2. Tool execution output is represented only by `ToolResult`.

URPV2-12. `ToolResultContent` MUST be the discriminated union below.

```text
ToolResultContent =
  | Text { type: "text", text: String, ...extra_body }
  | Image { type: "image", source: ImageSource, ...extra_body }
  | File { type: "file", source: FileSource, ...extra_body }
  | ProviderItem {
      type: "provider_item",
      origin_protocol: ProviderProtocol,
      item_type: String,
      body: JsonValue,
      ...extra_body
    }
```

URPV2-13. Sources MUST use the exact typed shapes below.

```text
ImageSource =
  | Url { type: "url", url: String, detail?: String }
  | Base64 { type: "base64", media_type: String, data: String }
  | FileId { type: "file_id", file_id: String, detail?: String }

AudioSource =
  | Url { type: "url", url: String }
  | Base64 { type: "base64", media_type: String, data: String }

FileSource =
  | Url { type: "url", url: String }
  | FileId { type: "file_id", file_id: String }
  | Text { type: "text", text: String }
  | Content { type: "content", content: Vec<JsonValue> }
  | Base64 {
      type: "base64",
      filename?: String,
      media_type: String,
      data: String
    }
```

URPV2-13a. A decoder that creates an `ImageSource::FileId` or `FileSource::FileId` MUST write the file-identifier namespace into the owning node or `ToolResultContent` extra body under internal key `_monoize_file_id_origin`. The value MUST be `openai` for Chat Completions or Responses file identifiers and `messages` for Anthropic Files API identifiers.

URPV2-13b. Provider file identifiers are provider-scoped opaque capabilities, not universally portable file references. A Chat Completions or Responses encoder MAY emit a typed file identifier only when `_monoize_file_id_origin = "openai"`. A Messages encoder MAY emit one only when `_monoize_file_id_origin = "messages"`. If the marker is absent or names the other namespace, the encoder MUST omit that image or file part. Chat Completions and Responses MAY translate file-id syntax between their two endpoint families because both use the OpenAI Files namespace. No adapter may infer portability from the identifier prefix or copy an OpenAI file identifier into Anthropic Files API syntax, or vice versa.

URPV2-13c. `_monoize_file_id_origin` is internal metadata under XTRA-10. Cross-family passthrough stripping MUST retain it until target encoding so URPV2-13b can be enforced. It MUST NOT appear on any wire object.

### 3.1 Ordinary node invariants

ORD-1. Every ordinary node MUST carry `role` directly on the node. No ordinary node may be nested under a message wrapper.

ORD-2. `Reasoning`, `ToolCall`, and `Refusal` nodes MUST use `role = "assistant"`.

ORD-3. `Text`, `Image`, `Audio`, `File`, and `ProviderItem` nodes MAY use any `OrdinaryRole`.

ORD-4. `Text.phase` belongs only to `Text` nodes.

ORD-5. `Text.phase`, when present, MUST be treated as an unconstrained string. The decoder MUST preserve unknown values byte-for-byte. The encoder MUST NOT rewrite or drop a non-empty `phase` value solely because the value is not recognized locally.

ORD-6. A decoder MUST emit one ordinary node for each source-order semantic unit that the upstream protocol exposes. The decoder MUST NOT first merge several ordinary units into a logical message envelope.

ORD-7. Ordinary node `extra_body` stores unknown fields that belong to exactly that ordinary node's protocol object.

ORD-8. If a key exists in both an ordinary node typed field and that node's `extra_body`, the typed field value MUST win.

ORD-9. `ProviderItem.origin_protocol` MUST be one of the Provider protocol names from §1. It records the exact protocol that supplied `ProviderItem.body`.

ORD-10. `ProviderItem` is a same-protocol opaque native carrier. A decoder MUST use it only for one native item, block, or part that the source adapter cannot represent as `Text`, `Image`, `Audio`, `File`, `Refusal`, `Reasoning`, `ToolCall`, or `ToolResult`.

ORD-11. An encoder MUST replay `ProviderItem.body` only when `ProviderItem.origin_protocol` exactly equals the target provider protocol. If the protocols differ, the encoder MUST ignore that `ProviderItem`. It MUST NOT stringify the body, insert it into a prompt, wrap it as `Text`, or disguise it as another typed node.

### 3.2 Reasoning invariants

RSN-1. `Reasoning.content` is plaintext reasoning text. `Reasoning.summary` is plaintext summary text. The two fields are semantically distinct.

RSN-2. A `Reasoning` node MAY carry `content`, `summary`, both, or neither.

RSN-3. If both `content` and `summary` are present, canonical URP storage MUST preserve both. One field MUST NOT overwrite the other.

RSN-4. `Reasoning.encrypted` is an opaque provider payload. URP MUST store it in the typed field `encrypted`. URP MUST NOT move that value into `extra_body` under ad hoc keys such as `signature`.

RSN-5. `Reasoning.source` is the exact provider-supplied source identifier when the provider sends one.

RSN-6. If upstream omits reasoning source, URP MUST leave `source` absent. URP MUST NOT invent a fallback source such as a router name, provider name, or model identifier.

RSN-7. If upstream sends an empty-string reasoning source, URP MUST treat it as absent.

RSN-8. Distinct `Reasoning` nodes are order-significant. URP MUST preserve their relative order exactly.

### 3.3 Tool-call and tool-result invariants

TCL-1. `ToolCall.call_id` MUST be non-empty.

TCL-2. `ToolCall.arguments` MUST be a JSON-encoded string. If a source protocol delivers structured arguments as a JSON object or array, the decoder MUST serialize that structured value to JSON text before storing it in `arguments`.

TCL-3. `ToolCall.tool_type` MUST be `function` for JSON-schema function calls and `custom` for freeform custom-tool calls. Missing `tool_type` in legacy internal data defaults to `function`.

TCL-4. `ToolResult.tool_type` MUST equal the correlated `ToolCall.tool_type`. A decoder that receives an explicitly typed Responses `custom_tool_call_output` MUST set `tool_type = "custom"`. A Chat tool-role result MUST inherit the type of the earlier call with the same `call_id`; if no correlated call is present, it defaults to `function`.

TR-1. `ToolResult` is a distinct top-level node. It MUST NOT carry `role`.

TR-2. `ToolResult.call_id` MUST be non-empty and MUST correlate to the originating `ToolCall.call_id` byte-for-byte.

TR-3. A terminal node sequence MUST NOT contain two distinct `ToolResult` nodes with the same `call_id`.

TR-4. `ToolResult.content` order is canonical. The encoder MUST preserve that order when rendering a protocol that supports multimodal tool results.

TR-5. `ToolResult.is_error` defaults to `false` when absent.

TR-6. `ToolResult.extra_body` stores unknown fields that belong to the protocol object representing that one tool result.

TR-7. If a key exists in both a `ToolResult` typed field and `ToolResult.extra_body`, the typed field value MUST win.

TR-8. `ToolResultContent.extra_body` stores unknown fields that belong to exactly that one content entry inside the tool result.

TR-9. If a key exists in both a `ToolResultContent` typed field and that entry's `extra_body`, the typed field value MUST win.

TR-10. A tool-result content block with no cross-family semantic mapping, including Anthropic `search_result` and `tool_reference`, MUST decode as `ToolResultContent::ProviderItem`. It MAY replay only when its `origin_protocol` equals the target protocol. Cross-family encoding MUST omit that entry rather than stringify its JSON body as user-visible text.

### 3.4 Control-node invariants

CTL-1. `NextDownstreamEnvelopeExtra` is the only control node kind in URP v2.

CTL-2. A control node carries no typed payload besides `type`. Every other field on the control node belongs to its flattened `extra_body`.

CTL-3. A control node does not represent user-visible content, a tool result, usage, or finish state.

CTL-4. A decoder MUST emit `NextDownstreamEnvelopeExtra` immediately before the first URP node derived from a protocol envelope when that protocol envelope contains unknown fields that do not belong to exactly one emitted ordinary node or `ToolResult` node.

CTL-5. A control node applies only to the next consumable envelope opened by the downstream encoder.

CTL-6. A control node is an explicit envelope boundary. When an encoder encounters a control node, it MUST flush any currently open consumable envelope before buffering that control node for later consumption.

CTL-7. Consecutive control nodes before one consumable envelope are legal. The encoder MUST merge their `extra_body` maps in source order. If the same key appears more than once, the later control node value MUST win.

CTL-8. When the encoder opens the next consumable envelope, it MUST merge the buffered control-node map into that envelope object. If a key exists in both the control-node map and a typed field generated by the adapter for that envelope, the typed field value MUST win.

CTL-9. A control node MUST NOT generate an empty downstream envelope by itself.

CTL-10. A valid terminal node sequence MUST NOT end with `NextDownstreamEnvelopeExtra`.

CTL-11. If a decoder or encoder reaches terminal end-of-sequence or end-of-stream while a control node remains unmatched, it MUST discard that control node and MUST NOT emit an empty envelope or an error solely because the node was unmatched.

## 4. Unknown-field passthrough and cross-family stripping

XTRA-1. URP v2 MUST preserve unknown top-level request and response fields in top-level `extra_body`.

XTRA-2. URP v2 MUST preserve unknown node-local fields in the owning ordinary node, `ToolResult`, or `ToolResultContent` `extra_body`.

XTRA-3. URP v2 MUST preserve unknown envelope-level fields with `NextDownstreamEnvelopeExtra` rather than inventing a synthetic message wrapper.

XTRA-4. Cross-family stripping applies only to nested passthrough state. Top-level request and response `extra_body` are not nested and are not removed by this rule.

XTRA-5. Immediately before an encode step into a different protocol family, the runtime MUST:

1. remove every non-internal member from `extra_body` on every ordinary node;
2. remove every non-internal member from `extra_body` on every `ToolResult` node;
3. remove every non-internal member from `extra_body` on every `ToolResultContent` entry; and
4. remove every `NextDownstreamEnvelopeExtra` control node.

A decoder-created or transform-created member reserved by XTRA-10 is internal semantic provenance, not nested wire passthrough. The runtime MUST retain such a member through XTRA-5 until the target adapter consumes or discards it. The target adapter MUST NOT emit the reserved member on the wire. This retained provenance includes `_monoize_chat_reasoning_detail`, which is required to apply MSG-6 to adjacent Chat reasoning-detail nodes after a Chat-to-Messages family transition.

XTRA-6. After XTRA-5, later transforms or adapters for the target family MAY add new target-family passthrough fields.

XTRA-7. On a same-family encode step, the runtime MUST preserve node `extra_body`, `ToolResultContent.extra_body`, and control nodes.

XTRA-8. The same-family passthrough rules in XTRA-4 through XTRA-7 do not authorize `ProviderItem` replay. `ProviderItem` replay is governed only by exact same-protocol equality under ORD-11.

XTRA-9. Before request-phase transforms run for one upstream attempt, the runtime MUST remove every downstream-origin `ProviderItem` whose `origin_protocol` differs from the selected upstream provider protocol. Later transforms MAY insert a `ProviderItem` only when they set `origin_protocol` to the intended target provider protocol.

XTRA-10. A key whose name starts with `_monoize_` is internal metadata, not wire passthrough. A wire decoder MUST treat that prefix as reserved and MUST NOT copy an incoming `_monoize_` member into an `extra_body`; only decoder or transform logic MAY create internal metadata after parsing semantic wire fields. An envelope reconstruction helper or protocol encoder MUST NOT emit such a key as a provider request field. A same-family encoder MAY consume an internal key to reconstruct the native field represented by its value, then MUST discard the internal key. For Chat `reasoning_details`, the raw detail object stored under `_monoize_chat_reasoning_detail` remains authoritative replay data; only the wrapper key is internal. An opaque same-protocol `ProviderItem.body` or `ProviderControl.data` MUST be cloned at its wire boundary. The clone MUST recursively remove object members whose keys start with `_monoize_`, including members below arrays, while preserving every other member. This sanitization MUST NOT mutate the canonical URP body or control data and MUST NOT apply to arbitrary typed or user payloads.

## 5. Canonical flat streaming events

STR-1. The canonical URP v2 streaming representation MUST be:

```text
UrpStreamEventV2 =
  | ResponseStart {
      id: String,
      model: String,
      ...extra_body
    }
  | NodeStart {
      node_index: u32,
      header: NodeHeader,
      ...extra_body
    }
  | NodeDelta {
      node_index: u32,
      delta: NodeDelta,
      usage?: Usage,
      ...extra_body
    }
  | NodeDone {
      node_index: u32,
      node: Node,
      usage?: Usage,
      ...extra_body
    }
  | ResponseDone {
      finish_reason?: FinishReason,
      usage?: Usage,
      output: Vec<Node>,
      ...extra_body
    }
  | ProviderControl {
      protocol: String,
      event_name: String,
      data: JsonValue,
      ...extra_body
    }
  | Error {
      code?: String,
      message: String,
      ...extra_body
    }
```

STR-2. `NodeHeader` MUST be the discriminated union below.

```text
NodeHeader =
  | Text { role: OrdinaryRole, phase?: String }
  | Image { role: OrdinaryRole }
  | Audio { role: OrdinaryRole }
  | File { role: OrdinaryRole }
  | Refusal { role: "assistant" }
  | Reasoning { role: "assistant" }
  | ToolCall { role: "assistant", call_id: String, name: String }
  | ProviderItem { origin_protocol: ProviderProtocol, role: OrdinaryRole, item_type: String }
  | ToolResult { call_id: String }
  | NextDownstreamEnvelopeExtra
```

STR-3. `NodeDelta` MUST be the discriminated union below.

```text
NodeDelta =
  | Text { content: String }
  | Reasoning {
      content?: String,
      summary?: String,
      encrypted?: JsonValue,
      source?: String
    }
  | Refusal { content: String }
  | ToolCallArguments { arguments: String }
  | Image { source: ImageSource }
  | Audio { source: AudioSource }
  | File { source: FileSource }
  | ProviderItem { data: JsonValue }
```

STR-4. `node_index` is a URP-local index. A decoder MUST assign `node_index` values sequentially starting at `0` in first-seen node order. A decoder MUST NOT reuse an upstream protocol index as a URP `node_index` by assumption alone.

STR-5. For each streamed `node_index`, there MUST be exactly one `NodeStart` and exactly one `NodeDone`. Every `NodeDelta` for that `node_index` MUST occur after `NodeStart` and before `NodeDone`.

STR-6. `ToolResult` and `NextDownstreamEnvelopeExtra` nodes MUST have zero `NodeDelta` events.

STR-7. `NodeDone.node` MUST contain the complete terminal node for that `node_index`.

STR-8. `ResponseDone.output` MUST contain the complete terminal ordered node sequence.

STR-9. `ResponseDone.output` is the authoritative final streamed response state. Downstream stream reconstruction, synthetic terminal event synthesis, and post-stream transforms MUST use `ResponseDone.output` rather than any ad hoc merged helper state.

STR-10. Stream decoders MUST emit flat nodes directly. They MUST NOT pre-group stream state into message envelopes before entering the URP event channel.

STR-11. Downstream stream encoders own logical envelope reconstruction from `NodeStart`, `NodeDelta`, `NodeDone`, and `ResponseDone.output`.

STR-12. `ProviderControl` is same-protocol stream passthrough for one valid provider event that has no typed URP event mapping. It MUST NOT create a node, consume a `node_index`, mutate `ResponseDone.output`, or cross a protocol-family boundary.

STR-13. A same-protocol stream encoder MAY replay `ProviderControl.data` only when `ProviderControl.protocol` equals the target protocol and `event_name` identifies the source wire event. Before replay, the encoder MUST clone `ProviderControl.data` and recursively remove every object member whose key starts with `_monoize_`, including members below arrays. The encoder MUST preserve all other members and MUST NOT mutate canonical `ProviderControl.data`. A mismatched encoder MUST drop the event without converting it to text or success state.

### 5.1 Delta accumulation invariants

SACC-1. For `NodeDelta::Text`, terminal `Text.content` is the ordered concatenation of all `content` fragments for that `node_index`.

SACC-2. For `NodeDelta::ToolCallArguments`, terminal `ToolCall.arguments` is the ordered concatenation of all `arguments` fragments for that `node_index`.

SACC-3. For `NodeDelta::Reasoning.content`, terminal `Reasoning.content` is the ordered concatenation of all non-null `content` fragments for that `node_index`.

SACC-4. For `NodeDelta::Reasoning.summary`, terminal `Reasoning.summary` is the ordered concatenation of all non-null `summary` fragments for that `node_index`.

SACC-4a. When a source protocol emits a later non-empty full-field done snapshot for `Reasoning.summary`, that snapshot replaces the delta concatenation for `NodeDone.node` and `ResponseDone.output`. A full-item done snapshot MAY also replace other non-empty reasoning fields. A non-empty terminal response-object summary is the final authoritative `ResponseDone.output` presentation and replaces any different accumulated summary without creating a terminal conflict. An empty done-snapshot or terminal-response field MUST NOT erase a non-empty accumulated field.

SACC-5. If a source protocol defines streamed `Reasoning.encrypted` values as fragments and each fragment is a string, terminal `Reasoning.encrypted` is the ordered concatenation of those raw string fragments. Anthropic Messages `signature_delta.signature` and the legacy Chat scalar `reasoning_opaque` are fragment surfaces. A Chat `reasoning_details[]` entry is one ordered reasoning-sequence element and is not a fragment of another entry.

SACC-5b. When reasoning envelopes are enabled, Monoize MUST NOT wrap each encrypted fragment independently. It MUST accumulate the raw fragments for one `node_index`, select the non-empty `NodeDone.node.encrypted` value as the authoritative complete value when present, and otherwise use the SACC-5 concatenation. Monoize MUST wrap that complete value exactly once before a response transform or downstream encoder observes it. A downstream encoder MAY split the one wrapped string only to satisfy the configured SSE frame limit. Concatenating all downstream string frames for that encrypted field MUST produce exactly one parseable `mz2.` envelope.

SACC-5c. A full encrypted terminal snapshot is one opaque value. If it differs from prior encrypted fragments or prior full snapshots, the terminal accumulator MUST replace its encrypted field atomically. It MUST NOT derive a prefix or suffix from the opaque value. This rule does not change the text and summary suffix rules in SACC-4a.

SACC-5a. A Responses `response.output_item.added.item.encrypted_content` value is one complete opaque lifecycle snapshot. It is not an incremental encrypted delta. A Responses stream decoder MUST preserve the complete added-event value in item-level `NextDownstreamEnvelopeExtra` state. It MUST NOT copy that value into `NodeDelta`, `NodeDone.node`, or the terminal reasoning accumulator. A same-Responses stream encoder MUST emit that preserved value in the matching downstream `response.output_item.added.item.encrypted_content` field. A later non-empty value from `response.output_item.done.item` is a separate complete snapshot. The decoder MUST store the done-event value as one atomic terminal value. It MUST NOT concatenate, splice, or partially overwrite encrypted lifecycle snapshots. A non-empty `response.completed.response.output[].encrypted_content` value MAY establish terminal `Reasoning.encrypted` when no done-event value exists.

SACC-6. If a provider supplies a non-string `Reasoning.encrypted` payload, the decoder MUST emit that value only in `NodeDone.node` and `ResponseDone.output`, or in exactly one `NodeDelta`. The decoder MUST NOT split a non-string JSON value across several deltas.

SACC-7. For `NodeDelta::Reasoning.source`, the terminal `Reasoning.source` value is the most recent non-empty `source` value seen for that `node_index`.

SACC-8. An empty-string `Reasoning.source` delta MUST be ignored.

SACC-9. `NodeHeader::ProviderItem` MUST carry `origin_protocol`. A downstream stream encoder MUST open and complete a ProviderItem lifecycle only when that origin protocol equals the downstream provider protocol. A mismatched ProviderItem stream node MUST be skipped without producing text or another typed node.

## 6. Encoder-owned logical envelope reconstruction

RECON-1. URP v2 canonical storage is only the flat node sequence. Message grouping, output-item grouping, and block grouping are encoder responsibilities.

RECON-2. An encoder MAY place consecutive ordinary nodes into one consumable envelope only when all conditions below hold:

1. every grouped value is an ordinary node;
2. no `ToolResult` node lies inside the grouped run;
3. no `NextDownstreamEnvelopeExtra` node lies inside the grouped run;
4. grouping preserves original node order exactly; and
5. grouping does not violate a protocol-specific boundary rule in this section.

RECON-3. A `ToolResult` node is always its own top-level semantic unit. An encoder MUST NOT merge a `ToolResult` node into an ordinary-node envelope.

RECON-4. A `ProviderItem` node is never eligible for generic message-compatible grouping. A family-specific encoder MAY replay it as a native item, block, or part only under ORD-11.

RECON-5. A control node is not itself emitted downstream. Its only effect is to modify the next consumable envelope under CTL-5 through CTL-8.

### 6.1 Responses stability and reconstruction

RESP-1. The Responses encoder MUST reconstruct canonical Responses output items from flat nodes.

RESP-2. Each `Reasoning` node MUST encode as one top-level Responses `reasoning` item.

RESP-3. Each `ToolCall(tool_type = "function")` node MUST encode as one top-level Responses `function_call` item. Each `ToolCall(tool_type = "custom")` node MUST encode as one top-level Responses `custom_tool_call` item with freeform `input`.

RESP-3a. `ToolResult(tool_type = "function")` MUST encode as `function_call_output`. `ToolResult(tool_type = "custom")` MUST encode as `custom_tool_call_output`.

RESP-4. Each maximal run of adjacent ordinary nodes that are not `Reasoning` and not `ToolCall`, and that share the same `role`, MAY encode as one Responses `message` item.

RESP-5. A change in `Text.phase` value inside a Responses `message` run MUST force a new Responses `message` item boundary.

RESP-6. `NextDownstreamEnvelopeExtra` applies to the next Responses output item envelope created under RESP-2 through RESP-4.

RESP-7. Responses streaming output MUST preserve canonical event lifecycle semantics:

1. `response.created` occurs before any output-item lifecycle event;
2. every emitted `response.output_item.done` has exactly one earlier matching `response.output_item.added` with the same `output_index`;
3. `response.content_part.added` and `response.content_part.done` are emitted for each Responses content-bearing item part, including `message` content and `reasoning.content[]` entries of type `reasoning_text`;
4. `response.completed` reflects the same reconstructed `response.output` ordering used by the terminal item lifecycle; and
5. the stream terminates with exactly one plain `data: [DONE]` sentinel.

RESP-8. The Responses encoder MUST preserve externally visible addressing and lifecycle semantics for `response_id`, `item_id`, `output_index`, `content_index`, and item `status`. These fields are encoder-owned output coordinates derived from the flat node order.

RESP-9. Responses external reasoning behavior remains stable:

1. summary text remains distinct from full reasoning text;
2. full reasoning text encodes in `reasoning.content[]` entries with `type = "reasoning_text"`, not in a top-level reasoning-item `text` field;
3. opaque reasoning payload remains typed reasoning data rather than plain text;
4. `source` is preserved when present upstream; and
5. `source` is omitted when upstream omitted it.

RESP-10. Downstream `/v1/responses` streaming MUST NOT introduce a custom `response.reasoning_signature.delta` event. Opaque reasoning state is surfaced only through canonical reasoning item events and terminal response state.

### 6.2 Anthropic Messages stability and reconstruction

MSG-1. The Messages encoder MUST reconstruct one Anthropic `message` envelope whose `content[]` block order matches flat-node order after applying protocol-required role and block mapping.

MSG-2. Each emitted Messages `content` block index MUST equal that block's final zero-based position in the reconstructed `content[]` array.

MSG-3. Messages streaming output MUST preserve this exact lifecycle order:

1. `message_start` first;
2. for each content block, `content_block_start`, then zero or more `content_block_delta`, then `content_block_stop`;
3. `message_delta` after the final `content_block_stop`;
4. `message_stop` last.

MSG-4. A Messages stream MUST NOT append `[DONE]`.

MSG-5. Content-block lifecycles MUST NOT interleave. At most one content block may be open at a time.

MSG-6. `Reasoning` nodes MUST reconstruct Anthropic `thinking` blocks. If adjacent Chat reasoning-detail nodes contain non-empty plaintext followed by an encrypted-only payload, a Messages encoder MUST render those two semantic surfaces in one thinking block while preserving the two URP nodes for same-Chat replay. If the stream exposes both thinking text and signature state, `thinking_delta` MUST occur before `signature_delta`, and both MUST occur before that block's `content_block_stop`.

MSG-7. `ToolCall(tool_type = "function")` nodes MUST reconstruct Anthropic `tool_use` blocks. Streamed tool input JSON remains block-scoped and index-scoped. Messages has no specified freeform custom-call lifecycle; its encoder MUST omit `ToolCall(tool_type = "custom")` and `ToolResult(tool_type = "custom")` rather than reinterpret freeform input as JSON tool input.

MSG-8. `ToolResult` nodes MUST reconstruct Anthropic `tool_result` blocks as distinct tool-result protocol objects. They MUST NOT be rewritten as ordinary role-bearing nodes.

MSG-8a. Consecutive `ToolResult` nodes MUST reconstruct as consecutive `tool_result` blocks inside one Anthropic user message envelope. A Messages encoder MUST NOT emit an empty text block solely to preserve an empty `Text.content` value.

### 6.3 OpenRouter-compatible Chat stability and reconstruction

CHAT-1. The Chat Completions encoder MUST preserve OpenRouter-compatible chat behavior. The flat redesign MUST NOT reduce the downstream contract to plain OpenAI Chat Completions.

CHAT-2. In non-stream chat responses, `choices[0].message.content` MUST remain a JSON string. If several text nodes are merged into one downstream assistant message, the encoder MUST concatenate them in source order with `"\n\n"` between adjacent text segments.

CHAT-3. Structured reasoning in chat responses MUST remain in `reasoning_details`. Plaintext assistant reasoning, when emitted as a simple scalar field, remains `message.reasoning` for non-stream and `delta.reasoning` only when the downstream protocol already defines that exact field for plain text.

CHAT-4. Chat `reasoning_details[]` entries MUST preserve the OpenRouter-compatible discriminated union:

1. `{ "type": "reasoning.summary", "summary": ... }`
2. `{ "type": "reasoning.text", "text": ..., "signature"?: ... }`
3. `{ "type": "reasoning.encrypted", "data": ... }`
4. `{ "type": "reasoning.server_tool_call", "tool_name": ..., "arguments": ..., "result": ..., "tool_call_id"?: ... }`

CHAT-4a. Every `reasoning_details[]` entry MAY carry `id`, `format`, and `index`. It MAY also carry future entry-local fields. A decoder MUST preserve those fields on the owning reasoning node, and a same-Chat encoder MUST replay them on the same entry.

CHAT-4b. Source detail order is canonical. A decoder MUST create one reasoning node per detail entry. An encoder MUST preserve repeated detail types and MUST NOT merge, reorder, or deduplicate entries. Scalar `reasoning` and `reasoning_content` fields are compatibility views and MUST NOT cause bytes already present in `reasoning_details[]` to be emitted twice.

CHAT-4c. Without an explicit response transform, non-empty `Reasoning.content` MUST encode as `reasoning.text` and MUST NOT encode as `reasoning.summary`.

CHAT-5. Opaque encrypted reasoning payloads MUST appear only in `reasoning_details[]` entries with `type = "reasoning.encrypted"` and field `data`.

CHAT-6. Streaming chat output remains data-only SSE and terminates with exactly one `[DONE]` sentinel.

CHAT-7. If streamed chat output emits tool-call deltas, terminal `finish_reason` semantics for that downstream stream remain `tool_calls`.

CHAT-7a. A Chat encoder MUST emit `ToolCall(tool_type = "function")` as `{type:"function",function:{name,arguments}}` and `ToolCall(tool_type = "custom")` as `{type:"custom",custom:{name,input}}`. A Chat decoder MUST accept both shapes in request history, non-stream output, and stream deltas. Chat tool-role results inherit the correlated call type so a later Responses encoder can choose `function_call_output` versus `custom_tool_call_output`.

CHAT-8. If cumulative usage is available when a successful Chat Completions stream terminates, the encoder MUST emit exactly one usage chunk after the empty-delta finish chunk and immediately before `[DONE]`. The usage chunk MUST use the same `id`, `object`, `created`, and `model` envelope values as the finish chunk, MUST set `choices` to an empty array, and MUST contain the cumulative `usage` object. The finish chunk MUST NOT contain a non-null `usage` object. If cumulative usage is unavailable, the encoder MUST omit the usage chunk.

CHAT-9. SSE comment lines and post-start chunk-shaped error payloads remain representable downstream. The flat URP redesign MUST NOT remove support for those externally visible chat stream forms.

## 7. Validity summary

VALID-1. A valid terminal URP v2 sequence is an ordered `Vec<Node>` with no `Message { role, parts }` wrapper.

VALID-2. A valid terminal sequence MUST NOT end with `NextDownstreamEnvelopeExtra`.

VALID-3. `ToolResult` remains a distinct top-level node variant and MUST NOT be reclassified as an ordinary role-bearing node.

VALID-4. Terminal stream state is authoritative. `ResponseDone.output` is the final flat node sequence.

VALID-5. Decoder complexity is minimized by emitting flat nodes only. Encoder complexity owns all logical envelope reconstruction.
